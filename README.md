# PyCheckers
<h2>Variant of Checkers made with Python by Marcin WÄ™grzyn and Mateusz Satora</h2>

<b>Moving Pawns</b><br>
-Pawns always move diagonally one square at a time(unless capturing), and always move forward.<br>
-You can move your pawns by firstly selecting your pawn, and then selecting where you want to move it.<br>
  -Example: 'B2' and then 'C3'.<br>
-If you wish to select different pawn, type 'back' command.<br>

<b>Capturing</b><br>
-Capturing is mandatory if possible.<br>
-To capture an enemy pawn, you must first select your pawn and then select space where your pawn will end up after that capture.<br>
  -Example: 'B2', and then 'D4' if you are capturing pawn on C3.<br>
-Right after capturing a pawn, if there is possible capture with the same pawn you selected at the start of the turn, you can preform a capture just by selecting space where your pawn would end up after capturing another pawn.<br>
  -Example: B2, then to capture pawnd on C3 you type 'D4', and then to capture pawn on C5, you just type 'B6'.<br>

<b>Promoted Pawns</b><br>
-When a pawn reaches its final row, it will promote.<br>
-Promoted pawns move like normal pawns, except they can move and capture backwards.<br>

<b>End of game</b><br>
-Game ends when a player or a computer loses all their pawns. In that case, they will lose, and other side is the winner. <br>
